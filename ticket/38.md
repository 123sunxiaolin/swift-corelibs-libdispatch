Make a public API for draining the main queue
=============================================


**Feature request:**
Create a public API that allows applications to poll the main queue, so that enqueued items can execute on Thread 0.

**Use case example:**
I'm developing a command-line application with an optional Cocoa GUI. I would like to modularize the Cocoa GUI, so that the main command-line application does not make any references to Cocoa unless the GUI module is loaded.

So in the main app, I'd like to simply call `dispatch_main()` instead of using CFRunLoop or NSRunLoop. But that doesn't work — `dispatch_main()` terminates Thread 0, which Cocoa needs, and instead runs items enqueued to the main queue on a nonzero thread.

I've found that if, instead of calling `dispatch_main()`, I do this:

    while(1)
    {
        _dispatch_main_queue_callback_4CF(0);
        usleep(10000);
    }

...I can enqueue GUI blocks using `dispatch_get_main_queue()` and my Cocoa GUI code works as expected. But it's not safe to use this private SPI.
