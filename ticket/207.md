dispatch\_source\_create does not allow a mask with type DISPATCH\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_DATA\_OR
=========================================================================================


Given the documentation for DISPATCH\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_DATA\_OR as seen below:

> DISPATCH\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_DATA\_OR
> A dispatch source that coalesces data obtained via calls to dispatch\_source\_merge\_data. A logical OR is used to coalesce the data. The handle is unused (pass zero for now). The mask is used to perform a logical AND with the value passed to dispatch\_source\_merge\_data.
> Available in iOS 4.0 and later.
> Declared in dispatch/source.h.

I thought I could call `dispatch_source_t source = dispatch_source_create(DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_DATA_OR, 0, 1, queue);` but this sets source to NULL. The reason is because in init.c there is no mask set for the CUSTOM\_OR event:

trunk/src/init.c

    const struct dispatch_source_type_s _dispatch_source_type_data_or = {
    730         .ke = {
    731                 .filter = DISPATCH_EVFILT_CUSTOM_OR,
    732                 .flags = EV_CLEAR,
    733                 .fflags = ~0,
    734         },
    735 };

and then in source.c there is an early return if the mask argument does not have any bits in common with the mask set on the type:

trunk/src/source.c

    dispatch_source_t
    51  dispatch_source_create(dispatch_source_type_t type,
    52          uintptr_t handle,
    53          unsigned long mask,
    54          dispatch_queue_t q)
    55  {
    56          const struct kevent *proto_kev = &type->ke;
    57          dispatch_source_t ds = NULL;
    58          dispatch_kevent_t dk = NULL;
    59  
    60          // input validation
    61          if (type == NULL || (mask & ~type->mask)) {
    62                  return NULL;
    63          }

Since the type has an implicit mask of zero, no input mask is possible.

One fix would be to change 61 to

    if (type == NULL || ((mask & ~type->mask) && type->ke.filter != DISPATCH_EVFILT_CUSTOM_OR))

but then also line 90 from source.c

    90         dk->dk_kevent.fflags |= (uint32_t)mask;

would need to be the following for the OR type

    90         dk->dk_kevent.fflags &= (uint32_t)mask;

Not sure exactly what the proper fix is here, as I don't have that much experience with this code, but definitely the OR custom event type does not do what the documentation says it does.
