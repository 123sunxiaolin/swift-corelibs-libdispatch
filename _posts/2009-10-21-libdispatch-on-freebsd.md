The libdispatch library is available in the FreeBSD ports collection for experimental use on FreeBSD 9.x. Several kqueue kernel enhancements are [planned](http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2009-04-2009-09.html) for FreeBSD 8.1 in order to allow the libdispatch port to be used on FreeBSD 8.x as well.

Information is available on the [FreeBSD wiki](http://wiki.freebsd.org/GCD) about installing the libdispatch, llvm-devel, and compiler-rt ports allowing full use of the blocks extension to C with libdispatch.
