default -march=i686 fails to build on x86\_64
=============================================


Trying to build the software on Linux/amd64 generates the following error:

    apply.c:1: error: CPU you selected does not support x86-64 instruction set

The workaround is to change one line in src/Makefile.am:

    -libdispatch_la_CFLAGS+=-march=i686
    +libdispatch_la_CFLAGS+=-march=opteron

A more permanent solution would be some kind of autoconf/automake CPU detection test.
