libdispatch calls group notify functions too early
==================================================


According to the libdispatch manual pages, when a number of async calls are dispatched using a group, a notify callback set on the same group after those calls should only be invoked after each of the previous async calls have terminated. This specification seems to allow for a function to e.g. produce some shared data, queue N async jobs that read that data, and set a notify callback on the relevant group to release the shared data after it's known that all jobs on that data have completed.

The attached test program, in my opinion, seems to demonstrate that this interpretation of the manpages is not met by the Debian version "0~svn197-3" (amd64) of libdispatch. There is a workaround (activated with the --workaround switch) in this program that either obscures the issue or fails to trigger it. I have run the test program on a dual-core hyperthreaded Sandy Bridge mobile CPU and a dual-core Athlon X2-4200; it provoked the error on both.

My own hypothesis was that this was due to an imbalance between calls to sem\_wait() and sem\_post() in dispatch\_group\_wait(), leaving the group's semaphore in an off-by-one state. (Or perhaps the manual pages omitted something having to do with calling dispatch\_group\_enter() before calling dispatch\_group\_wait(), for the little sense that makes.) However, omission of calls to dispatch\_group\_wait(), enabled with the --no-wait switch, makes no difference wrt notify callbacks being called too early. The group goes to "zero asyncs in flight" in between regardless, though.
